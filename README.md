# Demo

Some Description!
## Repo cloned from github

**ls -la we can see all hidden files**

**git status provides the data on diff files present**

**git add . is used to track all files in git**

**git commit -m "name of the update" -m "description on update" is used to save the changes in git locally**

**git push is used to push(or)save the code to a remote repository such as github**

**ssh-keygen -t -rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com" is used to prove github that you are the real user, a key is generated specifically for the local machine in order to push the file into github** 

**git push origin main**

**cd ../"name of the directory needed to go" is the command**



## Repo from local machine

**git init makes a file into git repository**

**git remote add origin onlinerepolink adds it into the remote repo**

**git remote -v command shows any remote repos connected to the local repo**

**git push origin master can be used now**

**git push -u origin master can be used to make a shortcut(upstream) of typing only git push to push the file into the origin repo**

## Subheader

**git branch shows the branches**


**git checkout branchname helps in navigating to the branch specified**

**git checkout -b feature-readme creates new branch named feature-readme**

**git branch -d feature-readme deletes branch named feature-readme**

**git diff branchname shows the changes in the branch**

**git merge branchname from main, merges the changes in to the main branch**

**git pull from github to local machine, pr is done in github** 

**git commit -am "msg" command can be used to adding & committing at the same time, it works only for "modified" files**

**cd foldername is used to go to diff folders**

**cd ../"filename" to go different file in diff folder or to go back a folder**

**git reset HEAD resets the last step if Head-1 is taken then 1 step back of last step.i.e, 2 steps wil be reset back**

**git rest --hard linkofcommit removes completely without any staging**

Let's Do it.

Have Fun.
